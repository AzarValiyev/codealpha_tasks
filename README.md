## üß† Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals using financial data.

**Techniques Used:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (scaling, feature selection)
- Classification with Random Forest
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report
- Feature importance visualization

**Outcome:**  
A model that classifies individuals as likely to default or not based on their financial behavior.

## ü©∫ Task 2: Disease Prediction

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a person has a certain disease based on symptoms and medical history using classification algorithms.

**Techniques Used:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label encoding for categorical features
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Model evaluation with accuracy and precision metrics

**Outcome:**  
An accurate disease classification model useful for early diagnosis support.
